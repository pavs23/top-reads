# top-reads
My first dive into Kotlin. An app to retrieve top news articles from News API.

## Kotlin!
This is the first time I've used Kotlin, I've probably made a few mistakes.

Please feel free to leave comments in my code if you think I could have done it in a better way, it'll be much appreciated.

Big shoutout to the following people/orgs:
* juanchosaravia who has written a great tutorial on Kotlin which I referred to quite often: https://github.com/juanchosaravia/KedditBySteps
* NewsApi.org for providing the data

## Roadmap
* Prettify
    * Add pictures
    * Add descriptions
* Extend features to actually read the articles
* Infinite Scroll
* Asking user for preferences on news companies/sources
* Caching news articles for offline mode
